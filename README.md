# Customer Churn Prediction (Banking Domain)

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project! This machine learning-based classification model aims to help banks predict which customers are likely to cancel their accounts. By identifying the factors that lead to churn, banks can take proactive steps to retain valuable clients and improve profitability.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
Customer churn is a significant concern in the banking industry, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a simulated Kaggle dataset, representing real-world banking scenarios, to build a predictive model that identifies key factors driving customer churn.

### **Objectives:**
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the factors influencing churn.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Test the statistical significance of these factors.
3. **Model Development**: Develop and compare multiple machine learning models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Select and fine-tune the best-performing model.

## 🔍 **System Design**
The process follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Ensure the dataset is clean and accurate.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Discover patterns, trends, and outliers.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Validate findings statistically.
4. **Model Development**: Build classification models using various algorithms.
5. **Model Tuning**: Refine the best model for optimal results.

## 📊 **Key Findings**
- **Important Factors**: Demographics like age, gender, and geography were significant predictors of churn.
- **Best Model**: The Random Forest model delivered the best results with an accuracy of **85.32%**.

## 🏆 **Achievements**
- Identified key churn factors.
- Developed and tuned accurate classification models.
- Provided actionable insights to help banks retain customers.

## ⚠️ **Limitations**
- More diverse data is needed for further accuracy.
- Class imbalance in the dataset could impact model performance.

## 🔮 **Future Work**
- **Data Enhancement**: Incorporate more diverse datasets to improve the model.
- **Class Imbalance**: Address the imbalance for better model performance.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the models further to enhance precision.
